# Washington DC!

## Mount Vernon

Our first stop in DC was to Mount Vernon.  It was absolutely beautiful just as fall was starting to put some color in the trees.  Carson loved the farm area where there were sheep and pumpkins.  Carson loves the Peanuts show right now about the Great Pumpkin, so he was right at home.
