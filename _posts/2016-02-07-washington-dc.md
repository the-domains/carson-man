# Washington DC!

## Mount Vernon

Our first stop in DC was to Mount Vernon.  It was absolutely beautiful just as fall was starting to put some color in the trees.  Carson loved the farm area where there were sheep and pumpkins.  Carson loves the Peanuts show right now about the Great Pumpkin, so he was right at home.

## Lincoln Memorial

Lincoln Memorial is Uncle Nick favorite place, and he snapped this great photo of us.

## Washington Monument and National Mall.

It was great to get out and walk around the sites.  No Forest Gump sighting in the pool.  ![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e0d3a8de98862a3c7c8eb1d0e0db16a4/passthrough.jpg?height=600&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F52a5211a8970a7250d41ba65f386dad2064a3cb5.jpg)

I was probably most excited to go see all the amazing aircraft and share them with Carson and Nick.  So much history that changed the world based off flight.  So proud of Nick for working on the next pieces to be hanging from the rafters.
